Cet environnement est disponible sur Windows et Linux. \nLa dernière version recommandée et utilisée dans ce projet est appelée LTS (Long Time Support). A ce jour (22/05/2018), la dernière version NodeJS LTS est 8.11.2.\nCet environnement NodeJS embarque directement le gestionnaire de packages (librairies) pour notre application : NPM.\nDans un terminal (Windows ou Linux), les commandes permettant d'afficher les versions de ces outils devraient être disponibles et s'exécuter correctement :\n\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n\nGénération\nVous pouvez lancer le projet dans le mode souhaité avec les commandes suivantes :\n\nnpm run start : Lance le projet en local sur la machine à l'adresse suivante : http://localhost:4200.\nnpm run build : Créé le dossier contenant le site web packagé dans le dossier dist qui sera à la base du projet.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/environnement-technique.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/environnement-technique.html","title":"additional-page - Environnement technique","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nUn glossaire technique permettant de comprendre rapidement quels sont les outils utilisés dans le frontal.\nOutils\n\nNodeJS : Environnement d'exécution de commandes JavaScript.\nNPM : Gestionnaire de Packages (librairies) (Embarqué nativement dans NodeJS).\nAngular-CLI : Interface de ligne de commandes pour gérer un projet Angular (Dépendance NodeJS).\nWebpack : Module Bundler pour les applications JavaScript (Embarqué nativement dans Angular-CLI). Permet de concaténer les différents modules et ressources de l'application en un package optimisé.\nAngular : Framework de développement d'applications Web.\nTypeScript : Language de programmation qui représente un \"Sur-ensemble\" du JavaScript : Améliore et sécurise la production de code JavaScript.\nJenkins : Serveur d'automatisation des process : Permet d'assurer des \"job\" de déploiement, d'intégration continue, etc... pour tout type d'application.\nGitLab : Gestionnaire de projets.\n\nProduction\nPour résumer le but de chacun des outils dans ce projet :\nAkka Technologie utilise un dépôt GitLab pour gérer et suivre l'évolution de ses projet. La plupart de ces projets sont souvent liés à un serveur Jenkins pour assurer les différents processus d'Integration, de Production, et de Livraison.\nLe projet courant est une application Web réalisée en Angular / TypeScript. \nLe développement est réalisé dans un environnement NodeJS et NPM nous permet de nous assurer que les dépendances fonctionnelles du projet sont valides à tout instant.\nAngular-CLI permet de manipuler la génération ainsi que la construction de l'appplication dans tous les environnements souhaités (Développement, Integration, Production, ...) et garantit performance et rapidité de l'application grâce à un packaging maîtrisé avec Webpack.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
